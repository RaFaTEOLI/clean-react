This application was made during a course by Rodrigo Manguinho at Udemy.

The course's objective is to show how to create a system with React, using the latest technologies, such as Hooks, Recoil and a well defined architecture and also decoupled, using TDD for testing, Clean Architecture to organize the code and distribute the responsability across layers, always following the best design patterns and practices such as SOLID, DRY, YAGNI, KISS.
